Gives lots of UT fragments and Transcendence materials Dailies royal dungeon - where most of your gold comes from conquest - where most of your XP comes from friends - exchange points with them to use at inn inn - you get a free hero every 18 days and you can spin the wheel for rewards. Extra amity points can be spent on stamina or NPC gifts. world boss (WB) - reward box, crystallized powder to spend on artifacts PvP - do LoV once a day for tokens, and macro LoH for tokens guild raid - rewards for fighting the guild boss, even if you suck stockade - skill books for improving skills. VERY important as a new player upper dungeon - mats for transcending central orvel - different events happen here, sometimes it's shit though daily missions - self explanatory Note: even if you suck and get one shot it\u2019s still worth it to do things like world boss and guild raids and pvp because you get rewards even for failing. Weeklies LoH - shop resets, lots of good things worth buying Tower of Ordeals - essence and infinity frags blacksmith - shop resets, very important to use 900k coins to buy NPC gifts.

If you catch one of these events you will probably want to spend almost all of your stamina potions farming the resources as it can speed up progression a ton, saving you countless hours. as a nub I got 1 shot constantly and I thought I was doing something wrong. when I got to a new boss in the story, when I first tried guild raid and lab and WB, etc. for me mostly it was from shit gear (low tier and unawoken) so don't worry cc is great: as a nub you might get 1 shot a lot as mentioned above, but there are many instances where if you manually spam your CC skills you can get a lot farther too much gold: as a nub they gave me a ton of gold, I remember being on day 3 and having 130m, I had no idea what to do with it. you want to save it for trans and upgrading gear. you can burn 100m in one day via Gfycat Now you can proceed to the advanced guide.","title":"Noob Quickstart"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-soft-guide","text":"teambuilding and the advanced section is currently under construction.","title":"Welcome to the Soft Guide"},{"location":"#the-cheat-sheet","text":"You want to play some KING'S RAID and you are too American to read?
